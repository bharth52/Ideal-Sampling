IDEAL SAMPLING 
# Aim:
To study the concept of ideal sampling in signal processing and its effect on a continuous-time signal. The goal is to understand how sampling works under ideal conditions, such as perfect reconstruction and no aliasing.

# Tools Required:
MATLAB / Python (with libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib)

To simulate the sampling process and visualize the waveforms.

Oscilloscope (optional) – If working with real hardware, for measuring continuous signals and sampling.

Signal Generator (optional) – To generate a continuous-time signal.
